            <p>Hi I am Dev Shah i am currently 15 years old and a programmer.</p>
            <p>I like coding beacuse you need to apply your logic to write a good error free code.</p>
            <p>I am learning coding from whitehatjr and my teacher is Aakanksha ma'am who is a very excellent teacher.</p>
            <p>I started learning coding from June 2 2021 and its almost been a year now.</p>
            <p>I have learnt many things from as basic as creating sprites to creating multiplayer games using database</p>
